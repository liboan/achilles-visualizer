# achilles-visualizer

Cell line data visualization application for Project Achilles datasets processed by the ATLANTIS feature-finding algorithm. This was one of my projects created during the Broad Summer Scholars Program at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard.

The Project Achilles experiment has produced large datasets containing the dependency of cancer cell lines on a wide variety of genes, along with features for each line including gene expression, copy number variation, and mutation data. The sheer size of these datasets poses a challenge to scientists seeking to analyze the data and search for potential genetic targets for treatments. This interactive tool creates multiple useful visuals from the dataset, allowing users to more easily analyze Achilles data and potentially discover new relationships between features and dependencies.
